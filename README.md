# Random Reddit Wallpaper Script

Downloads a wallpaper from r/wallpapers and sets it as the wallpaper
<br>
Requires a reddit account and an api key from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
<br>
To change the subreddit used, simply change the sub variable to whatever you want
<br>
This is made to work on GNU/Linux (I use arch btw :)
